# [ManagmentStudent]

## Overview

Welcome to [ManagmentStudent]! This Android application is built to [manage your student in term of collage].

## Technologies Used

### Database

- **Room**: Room is a powerful and flexible relational database library for Android. It provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, making it easier to work with databases in Android apps. Room allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management with support for complex relationships between entities.

    - **Relational Database**: Room enables the use of a relational database model, allowing you to define entities and establish relationships between them. This makes it well-suited for applications that require structured and organized data storage.

- **SharedPreferences**: SharedPreferences is a key-value pair storage solution for simple data persistence, often used for lightweight settings and preferences.

### Layout Structure

- **Navigation Component**: The Navigation Component is a part of Android Jetpack that simplifies the implementation of navigation in an Android app. It helps in managing the flow and structure of your app, making it more intuitive and maintainable.

- **Safe Args**: Safe Args is a Gradle plugin that helps with type-safe argument passing between fragments and activities. It eliminates the need for manually writing and parsing arguments, reducing the chances of runtime errors.

### Programming Language

- **Kotlin**: Kotlin is a modern programming language that is concise, expressive, and fully interoperable with Java. It is officially supported by Android, offering numerous advantages such as improved readability, less boilerplate code, and enhanced developer productivity.

### Design Pattern

- **Singleton Pattern Activity**: The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In the context of your app, using the Singleton Pattern for the main activity implies having a single entry point for your application, promoting efficient resource utilization and consistency.
